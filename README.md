The proof of bifurcations for mu = 1 and mu = .25 is contained in normforms/bifmu1.cpp and normforms/bifmu25.cpp. The proof of the heteroclinic connection for mu = .75 and mu = .95 is contained kscone/hetorclinic.75|99. Code used for integration is in kscalk. Remaining folders conatin work in progress.
